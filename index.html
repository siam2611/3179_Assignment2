  <h1>Population Impact on YouTube</h1>

      <p>The scatterplot depicts a positive correlation between population and revenue, with countries like India and the
        United States illustrating this trend. However, notable outliers including China, Peru, Venezuela, and Bangladesh
        challenge this pattern. China's restriction of platforms like YouTube, unique economic structure, and wealth
        disparities may explain its position. Peru's reliance on volatile industries and regional disparities may contribute
        to its outlier status. Venezuela's economic crisis and political instability play a pivotal role in its low revenue
        despite oil wealth, while Bangladesh's underdeveloped economic structure and agrarian economy could clarify its
        position. It is essential to consider factors like economic structure, political stability, and global economic
        conditions alongside population in understanding a country's revenue.</p>

        This scatterplot, depicting the relationship between population, total earnings, and earnings per capita, reveals
        insightful nuances in economic performance. Notably, countries like Barbados and Latvia, with smaller populations,
        exhibit large circle sizes, indicating robust earnings per capita and efficient resource utilisation. In contrast,
        India, despite its substantial total earnings, presents a smaller circle size, highlighting the challenge of income
        distribution among a large population. This underscores the significance of normalisation when assessing a country's
        economic well-being and emphasises the pivotal role of population size in shaping a nation's earnings, reinforcing the
        need for a nuanced approach to cross-country comparisons.</p>

      <p>This choropleth graph effectively illustrates the distribution of subscribers by country, with dark blue indicating
        high subscriber counts and green representing lower counts, while yellow denotes countries with minimal or unavailable
        data. Notably, countries such as the United States, India, Brazil, and South Korea are characterised by dark blue,
        signifying substantial subscriber numbers and a general trend that correlates larger populations with higher
        subscriber counts. Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge that this relationship is not uniform across all
        nations, as other factors like economic development, technological infrastructure, and cultural influences play a
        role. The presence of countries in yellow suggests data limitations or exceptionally low subscription rates,
        influenced by various socio-economic and political factors. This graph provides a valuable snapshot of global
        subscription patterns, indicating both population-driven trends and regional disparities.</p>

    <div class="text">
      <p>This choropleth graph, now normalised for subscribers per capita, reveals significant shifts in the color scheme and
        provides a fairer basis for comparing countries' subscription patterns. India and Brazil, previously depicted in dark
        blue, now appear in a lighter blue shade, signifying a lower subscribers-to-population ratio. In contrast, China,
        which was originally light blue, transitions to yellow, indicating a notably lower subscribers-per-capita ratio. The
        United States and South Korea maintain their original colors, emphasising their robust performance in terms of
        subscribers per capita. This normalisation underscores the importance of considering population size when assessing
        subscription patterns, allowing for a more equitable and insightful comparison among countries. It demonstrates that a
        high subscriber count alone does not necessarily equate to a strong subscription rate per capita, highlighting the
        need for nuanced analysis to gauge the true impact of digital services across different nations.
